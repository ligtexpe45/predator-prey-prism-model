# Script for One Region
# This script runs a PRISM model simulation in parallel for different parameter values.
# It sweeps through values of c1 and c3 from 0.1 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1,
# executing the PRISM model with these parameters and printing the results.
# It prints goat extinction probabilities for each combination of c1 and c3.
